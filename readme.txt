ForceOrders

Python Script written to automate the task of forcing orders to pending and printing them
as a part of my job in the Shop From Home Department at Shoprite. The script uses the 
Selenium Webdriver to navigate the pages and perform the task normally performed by 
a person. This frees up workers to perform other important tasks while the computer
performs this sometimes time consuming task. 

The script had to be written to run off of a flash drive on a computer where no administrative 
access is allowed, hence the need for Python GUI to initiate the script and take in input 
from the user.
